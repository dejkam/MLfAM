This is the repository for the snippets of the Machine Learning for Asset Managers written by Marcos M. Lopez de Prado.  Solutions to the exercises are found in this repository as well. Each notebook contains python codes and the corresponding explanation taken from the text. However, in some cases, I come with more clarification to add more clarity to the topic or a problem.
